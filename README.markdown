# ClojureScript nREPL Exercise

This is a test repo to verify that I'm still sane while setting up ClojureScript REPL via nREPL.

### Usage:

To start nREPL via `lein repl`:

```
lein nrepl
```

To start the REPL via rebel-readline:

```
lein rebl
```

and then in the REPL run:

- `(start-nrepl!)` to start the nREPL server
- `(fig)` to start figwheel-main with rebel-readline
